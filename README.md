# Python
Basics of Python Programming
Python is a case sensitive whose index starts from 0
It also uses whitespace(tabs or spaces) to indent code instead of using braces
Python module in simply a '.py' file

There are six commonly used data types
int/long - Large int automatically converts to long
float - 64 bits there is no 'double' type
bool - true or false

str - ASCII valued in python 2x Unicode in python3
    String can be in single/double/triple quotes
    String is a sequence of characters, thus can be treated like other sequences
    Special character can be done via \ or preface with r
str(), bool(), int() and float() are also explicit type cast functions

NoneType(None) - Python 'null value (ONLY one instance of None object exists)
-None is not a reserved keyword but rather a unique instance of NoneType

There is a built-in python 'datetime' module provides 'datetime', 'date', 'time' types

Note: Most of the objects in Python are mutable except for 'strings' and 'tuples'
